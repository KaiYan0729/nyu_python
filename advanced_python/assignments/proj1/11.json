{"name": "Financial District/Wall Street",
 "description": "Now you are in Financial District/Wall Street. The Financial District (FiDi), at the southern tip of NYC, was the original settling point of New Yorkers in the 1600s, when the island of Manhattan was purchased by the Dutch from the Indians for 60 guilders (about $24). It is one of NYC's most bustling business and tourist areas, from Monday to Friday only. It is near dead on the weekends. In recent years, the construction of modern high rise buildings have started attracting more residents and new New Yorkers.",
