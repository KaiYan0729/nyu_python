{"name": "Upper West Side ",
 "description": "Now you are in Upper West Side. The Upper West Side is a residential neighborhood filled with young professionals and families. It is a great place to stay if you are looking to avoid the heavy crowds of Midtown and Times Square, but still be very close to all the major attractions and subway access. It is especially great if you want to be right near Central Park. The UWS is home to much of NYC's Art, Culture, Museums, shopping and restaurants.",
