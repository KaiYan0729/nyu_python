 "description": "Now you are in Garment District Fashion Center. The Garment District, also called the Fashion District or Fashion Center, is home to many of the world's most famous fashion designers. The area is an amazing resource for fabrics, beads and trims, however, don't expect to walk in off the street to Donna Karan or Calvin Klein's showroom or sample sales. The best way to possibly get access to private showrooms is through a private tour, otherwise, make sure to check NYC Sample Sales while you're in town.",
