{"name": "Lower East Side",
 "description": "Now you are in Lower East Side. Traditionally, the Lower East Side was a working class immigrant neighborhood (think 'Gangs of New York'). Today it is a wonderfully ethnic and diverse neighborhood and serves as a shopping, dining and nightlife destination for many NYC locals. Even with all its modern upgrades, the LES retains a large amount of its history, especially it's Jewish, Polish, Irish and Italian cultures.",
